# logD<sub>7.4</sub> Dataset of 1,130 Compounds

This repository archives a high-quality human-curated dataset that includes the chemical structure (SMILES) of 1,130 organic compounds and their n-octanol/buffer solution distribution coefficients at pH 7.4 (logD<sub>7.4</sub>). This dataset can be used for method benchmarking in cheminformatics and chemometrics research.

The dataset was originally curated by the paper '_In silico_ evaluation of logD<sub>7.4</sub> and comparison with other prediction methods' <[DOI:10.1002/cem.2718](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cem.2718/full)> ([PDF](https://nanx.me/papers/logd.pdf)).
