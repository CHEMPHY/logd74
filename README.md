# logD<sub>7.4</sub> of 1,130 Compounds <img src="logo.png" align="right" alt="logo" height="180" width="180" />

This repository archives a high-quality hand-curated [lipophilicity dataset](logd74.tsv) that includes the chemical structure (SMILES) of 1,130 organic compounds and their _n_-octanol/buffer solution distribution coefficients at pH 7.4 (logD<sub>7.4</sub>), originally curated by [our paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cem.2718/full) ([PDF](https://nanx.me/papers/logd.pdf)).

## About logD<sub>7.4</sub>

As a determinant of several ADME properties, lipophilicity (logD<sub>7.4</sub>) is a key physical property in the development of small molecule oral drugs. This dataset can be applied for method benchmarking in regression modeling, cheminformatics, and chemometrics research.
